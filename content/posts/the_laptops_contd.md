It's October. Still have two personal laptops. Both running nixos; well, both *were* running nixos. Long story short, I messed up my boot loader on one laptop and couldn't get it to boot (keep hardware-configs outside your version control so you don't rebuild with the hardware config for another PC.) Never mind that though, I don't think nixos is worth the trouble. Let me explain.  
  
Originally, I wanted my laptops to be replicated. The *functional* property of nixos and its configuration files made it ideal for this. Problem is, it got in my way too many times. Trying to set up a python development environment took too long. Trying to configure pycharm's debugger to work with it took too long. Trying to replicate virtualenv's were tedious. On top of that, I made a mistake and soft nuked one of my laptops. This many cons for the potential luxury of being able to pick up where I left off seamlessly? Not worth it.  
  
Today I have Ubuntu installed (for the millionth time) again and I'll probably either forget about trying to implement this cool feature (I guess lots of ideas come when you're bored in quarantine) or ignore it until I'm free again, which at this point doesn't seem like it'll ever happen anytime soon.  
  
That is all.
